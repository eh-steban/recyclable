## Commit Messages

### Format

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Example:**

```text
feat(parser): add creep wave tracking to lane pressure analysis

- Parse all four creep entities per wave
- Expose wave data via /parse endpoint
- Store snapshots at 1-second intervals
```

---

### Types

Commits MUST use one of the following types:

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New user-facing feature (SemVer MINOR) |
| `fix` | Bug fix (SemVer PATCH) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Tooling, dependencies, build process |
| `ci` | CI/CD pipeline changes |

---

### Scope

Scope is OPTIONAL. When included, it MUST describe the affected service or
area in lowercase, enclosed in parentheses.

```text
feat(parser): ...
fix(frontend): ...
chore(backend): ...
```

---

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes MUST be indicated in one of two ways:

1. Append `!` after the type/scope: `feat!: remove legacy parse endpoint`
2. Include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit body

---

### Rules

- Subject line MUST follow `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
- Type MUST be one from the types table above
- Description MUST be written in imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix",
  "remove")
- Subject line MUST NOT exceed 72 characters total
- Body is OPTIONAL -- omit it for changes whose subject line is
  self-explanatory (small fixes, one-file edits, obvious renames). A
  subject-only commit is fine when the diff is small enough that prose
  would just restate it.
- When a body IS included: precede it with a blank line; bullets SHOULD
  convey impact, not mechanics; three to four bullets is enough.
- MUST NOT append `Co-Authored-By` or any attribution lines
- SHOULD NOT include implementation details -- describe *what* changed and
  *why*, not *how*

---

### What to Write

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| `feat: add lane pressure visualization` | `feat: add LanePressureChart component that uses useMemo to memoize filtered array` |
| `fix: correct creep wave count off-by-one` | `fix: change <= 4 to < 4 in creep entity loop condition` |
| `feat(parser): expose boss state in output` | `feat(parser): add boss_snapshots: Vec<BossSnapshot> field and serialize with serde` |
| `chore: upgrade parser dependencies` | `chore: run cargo update and bump serde from 1.0.195 to 1.0.197` |

---

## Branch Names

Branches MUST follow [Conventional Branch][conventional-branch] format:

[conventional-branch]: https://conventional-branch.github.io/

```text
<type>/<description>
```

### Types

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `feature/` | New feature work |
| `fix/` | Bug fix |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent production fix |
| `release/` | Release preparation |
| `chore/` | Tooling, deps, maintenance |

### Rules

- Description MUST be lowercase, using only `a-z`, `0-9`, and hyphens
- No consecutive hyphens, no leading/trailing hyphens in the description
- Include ticket number when applicable: `feature/issue-123-login-flow`
- Dots are permitted only in `release/` branches for version numbers:
  `release/v1.2.0`

### Examples

```text
feature/player-lane-pressure
fix/parse-timing
hotfix/security-patch
release/v1.2.0
chore/upgrade-parser-deps
feature/issue-42-souls-tracking
```

### `scripts/wt` integration

`wt create <name>` defaults the branch to `feature/<name>`. Pass an explicit
second arg for other types:

```bash
scripts/wt create fix-parse-timing fix/parse-timing        # fix/ branch
scripts/wt create souls feature/souls-tracking             # explicit feature/
scripts/wt create release-v2 release/v2.0.0               # release/ with version
```
