# Quality Criteria: Rules and Mental Models

Rules files (.claude/rules/**/*.md) are **living standards documents** --
they capture service-specific architecture, coding patterns, testing
strategies, and observability conventions. Mental models document
non-obvious system behaviors that cause bugs if misunderstood.

## File subtypes

### Mental models (*-mental-model.md)

Document the "why behind the what" -- non-obvious behaviors, gotchas,
data flow quirks. These prevent expensive debugging cycles by making
invisible constraints visible.

### Testing rules (testing.md)

Document service-specific test patterns, layer conventions, and what must
be tested.

### Observability rules (observability.md)

Document logging conventions, structured log formats, and instrumentation
expectations.

### Cross-service rules (error-handling.md, observability.md at rules/ root)

Document patterns that apply across all services.

## Evaluation criteria

### 1. Groundedness (critical)

- Every pattern described must reflect the actual codebase, not
  aspirations
- Include concrete examples from real code (file paths, function
  signatures)
- Mental models must describe behavior that has been verified, not
  theorized
- **Anti-pattern:** "We should adopt X pattern" -- if it's not
  implemented, it doesn't belong here

### 2. Actionability

- A developer (or agent) reading this file should know exactly what to
  do differently
- Rules should be specific enough to automate a check against
- Good: "Domain services must not import from infrastructure layer"
- Bad: "Keep code clean and well-organized"

### 3. Non-obviousness

- Only document things Claude wouldn't figure out from reading the code
  alone
- Mental models exist because the system behavior is surprising or
  counterintuitive
- Good: "positions[0] is a pre-game frame, not match start"
- Bad: "The backend uses FastAPI" (Claude can see this from imports)

### 4. Concrete examples

- At least one concrete example per rule or pattern
- Examples should reference actual project files or realistic scenarios
- Mental models should include "What goes wrong if you ignore this"
  scenarios

### 5. Service isolation

- Rules in .claude/rules/backend/ should only cover backend patterns
- Rules in .claude/rules/frontend/ should only cover frontend patterns
- Cross-service patterns belong in .claude/rules/ root, not duplicated
  per service

### 6. Completeness across services

Cross-file check -- each service should have:

- mental model (if the service has non-obvious behaviors)
- testing.md (test patterns and coverage expectations)
- observability.md (logging conventions)

Flag any service missing a standard rule file that other services have.

### 7. Connection to learnings

- Patterns that originated from cross-project learnings should reference
  their source: "See `private/learnings.md#anchor`"
- If a learning has graduated to a permanent rule, the learning entry
  should note this
- Check: are there promoted learnings that should have been captured as
  rules but weren't?

### 8. Budget

- No explicit line limit, but rules files should be focused
- If a rules file exceeds ~200 lines, consider splitting by concern
- Mental models should be especially concise -- capture the insight, not
  a tutorial

## Common issues

1. **Aspirational content:** Describes patterns the team wants to adopt,
   not current state
2. **Obvious information:** Documents things Claude can infer from reading
   the code
3. **Missing examples:** Rules without concrete examples are hard to apply
   correctly
4. **Cross-service leakage:** Backend testing patterns duplicated in
   frontend testing.md
5. **Stale patterns:** Code evolved but rules file still describes old
   approach
6. **Orphaned from learnings:** A learning was promoted to a rule but the
   learning entry wasn't updated to note "graduated to rule"
