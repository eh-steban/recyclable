Commit staged and unstaged changes following project git conventions.

1. Run `git status` (never -uall) and `git diff` (staged + unstaged) to understand what changed
2. Run `git log --oneline -5` to match recent commit message style
3. Draft a commit message:
   - Subject line: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>` -- MUST be ≤72 chars
   - Type MUST be one of: feat, fix, refactor, perf, test, docs, chore, ci
   - Description MUST be imperative mood, lowercase after the colon
   - Optional body: 3–4 bullets describing impact/why, not mechanics
   - Breaking changes: append `!` after type, or use `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
   - NO Co-Authored-By or attribution lines (ever)
4. Stage relevant files by name -- never `git add -A` or `git add .`
   Do not stage .env files, credentials, or large binaries
5. Commit via HEREDOC to preserve formatting
6. Run `git status` to confirm success. Do not push unless asked.
